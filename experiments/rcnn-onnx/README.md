# RCNN-ONNX

Pretrained model from the ONNX Model Zoo (https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/object_detection_segmentation/mask-rcnn).

### Plan
1. Put a simple interface around the model
2. Find a profiling/evaluation metric for inference
    - Compare performance with yolov8 on onnx, stardist(current model deployed on piximi)
