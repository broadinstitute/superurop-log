# U-NET (implemented, trained, pruned, quantized, fine-tuned from scratch)

The purpose of this experiment is to get familiar with the optimizing pipeline,
and the U-Net model, which is the backbone for other models of interest e.g.
Stardist, Mask R-CNN.

A consequential goal is to learn how much optimization we can siphon while maintaining/
improving accuracy.
